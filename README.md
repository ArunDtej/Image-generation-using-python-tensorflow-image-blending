# Image-generation-using-python-tensorflow-image-blending
This is an AI model that uses Neural networks to generate images/blend multiple images.  
You can replace the images in the images folder with your own custom dataset. 
This model is a simple model with few neural network layers which can work well with generating simple and object centered images with not much variation between images of same category.

Steps of usage :

1 - Run the main python jupyter code to run the code and train the model.

2 - Run the load_model python code to load the pretrined model.
